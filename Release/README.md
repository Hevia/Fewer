# Artifact of Few

Artifact of Few is still early in development. Expect bugs!

The goal with Artifact of Few is to reduce the amount of monsters in play. I made this mod so older PCs don't drop to 3 FPS when playing modded loop runs

## TODO:
- Custom icons (right now its still just the swarm icon)
- Balance changes (I havent touched interactable spawn rates...)
- Make everything configurable.
- Add a 2nd artifact that operates similar to Few, but increases Elite and Variance spawn rates.
- proper project deps
- Better README

## Credit
- Thanks to swuff and HIFU for the idea to use Team catalog to reduce the overall monster cap.
- Thanks to Starstorm team and swuff for the Typhoon code I based this mod on.
